# Movie-Genre-Prediction
As the amount of capital spent on film making becomes higher, the need to forecast
a film’s success early on has risen. Various measures have been taken to satisfy this
need. The majority of the proposals have been based on movie ratings, trailer movie
excerpts, and social media postings. Both of these, though, are only available after a
film has been made and released. We suggest a deep-learning-based approach to predict
a movie’s success using only its plot summary text to allow an earlier prediction of its
results. The findings of the suggested procedure’s feasibility assessment are discussed
in this article, which is accompanied by discussions and future works.
We have used python to develop this project. Using deep learning and NLP we have implemented this 
project.
We have collected the dataset from github, I have added the dataset link also. Moreover, I have also 
added the report of our project, to help the users to understand it.
